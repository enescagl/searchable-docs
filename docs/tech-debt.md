# Technical Debt Tracking

This document tracks technical debt and areas for improvement in the Searchable Docs project.

## Current Technical Debt

### Database Optimization
- **Vector Storage Format**: Current storage of embeddings as raw buffers is not optimized for vector operations
- **Missing Indexes**: Need indexes on frequently queried fields to improve performance
- **Schema Evolution**: Need a more robust migration system for schema changes

### Code Architecture
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- **Type Definitions**: Incomplete or missing TypeScript types in some areas
- **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated tests for core functionality
- **API Documentation**: Missing OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for endpoints

### Performance Issues
- **Large Repository Processing**: Processing large repositories can be slow and memory-intensive
- **Embedding Generation**: Sequential processing of embeddings is inefficient
- **Search Response Time**: Vector similarity search can be slow with large numbers of embeddings
- **UI Performance**: Some components re-render unnecessarily

### Security Concerns
- **API Rate Limiting**: Missing rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Inconsistent validation across API endpoints
- **Dependency Auditing**: Need regular security audits of dependencies
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables not properly managed

### User Experience
- **Error Recovery**: Limited ability to recover from failed processing
- **Loading States**: Inconsistent loading state indicators
- **Search Feedback**: Limited feedback on search relevance and results
- **Accessibility**: Incomplete accessibility implementation

## Prioritized Improvements

### High Priority
1. Add database indexes for frequently accessed fields
2. Implement consistent error handling across API endpoints
3. Add proper validation for all user inputs
4. Optimize embedding generation for better performance
5. Implement API rate limiting

### Medium Priority
1. Create comprehensive test suite for core functionality
2. Optimize vector storage format for better performance
3. Improve chunking algorithm for better search results
4. Enhance UI loading states and error handling
5. Complete TypeScript type definitions across the codebase

### Low Priority
1. Add OpenAPI documentation for API endpoints
2. Implement accessibility improvements
3. Create more robust schema migration system
4. Reduce unnecessary component re-renders
5. Setup automated dependency security scanning

## Technical Debt Management Process

1. **Identification**: Record new technical debt items in this document
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and prioritize accordingly
3. **Planning**: Schedule debt reduction work in appropriate sprints
4. **Resolution**: Address debt items according to priority
5. **Prevention**: Review and refine development practices to prevent new debt

## Debt Reduction Timeline

- **Sprint 1-2**: Focus on critical performance and security issues
- **Sprint 3-4**: Address architectural concerns and testing gaps
- **Sprint 5-6**: Improve user experience and accessibility
- **Ongoing**: Regular dependency and security audits
